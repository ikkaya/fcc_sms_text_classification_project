Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

A deep learning model, that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam", was developed by using LSTM. A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company for commercial purposes.

The challenge was achieved with 98% accuracy to predict a taken message is"ham" or "spam".
